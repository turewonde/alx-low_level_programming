# C - Search Algorithms


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Linear search**
  * [0-linear.c](./0-linear.c): Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
  *Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
  *Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
  *size is the number of elements in array
  *And value is the value to search for
  *Your function must return the first index where value is located
  *If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
  *Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
* **1. Binary search***
* **2. Big O #0**
* **3. Big O #1**
* ** Big O #2**
* **5. Big O #3**
* **6. Big O #4**
* **7. Jump search**
* **8. Big O #5**
